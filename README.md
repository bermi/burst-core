###What does it do?

The Burst-Core brings time-line animation control to JavaScript. Based on the classic structure: **Time-line > Track > Key-frame**, Burst-Core is suitable for complex, multi-layered, non-linear animations. Burst-Core also supports method-chaining and call-back architecture to support rich, interactive use cases.

###What can it control?

- WebGL Objects
- Processing JS Game Characters
- DOM Objects
- SVG Elements
- Audio Signals
- Anything with values that changes over time
